            <h2>Population & Demographics</h2>
            <p>As of 2024, the total population of the Philippines is estimated to be 118,277,063 people. According to the CIA World Factbook, the ethnic composition is primarily Tagalog (26%), followed by Bisaya/Binisaya (14.3%) and Ilocano (8%) as of 2020. Other significant ethnic groups include Cebuano (8%), Illonggo (7.9%), Bikol/Bicol (6.5%), and Waray (3.8%). Those classified as other local ethnicities account for 18.5%, while foreign ethnicities represent 0.2%. In terms of language, Tagalog and Bisaya are the primary native language groups, with Tagalog spoken by 39.9% of the population and Bisaya/Binisaya by 16%. Other notable languages include Hiligaynon/Ilonggo (7.3%), Ilocano (7.1%), and Cebuano (6.5%). The official languages are Filipino (based on Tagalog) and English, along with eight recognized major dialects (CIA, 2020).

The Philippines is predominantly Roman Catholic, with 78.8% of the population identifying as such. Muslims make up 6.4%, while Iglesia ni Cristo accounts for 2.6%, and other Christian denominations and religious affiliations comprise about 12.1% (CIA, 2020). Rooted in Catholicism introduced during the Spanish colonial period, Filipino culture profoundly shapes societal norms and values. Many Filipinos hold a deep sense of national identity shaped by their long struggle for independence, but their loyalty often lies with family, local communities, and provinces. This strong sense of community emphasizes collective interests and pride in family and local traditions. Interactions are often shaped by age and social status, with terms like "kuya" and "ate" used to show respect for elders. The concept of "hiya," or saving face, emphasizes social etiquette and the value of hospitality. Multi-generational family structures highlight a strong focus on respecting elders. While traditional values remain important, modern influences are changing practices, especially in dating and marriage, where individual choice is becoming more accepted (Mosaica, 2017).</p>
